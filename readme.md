## Description
This project involves preprocessing and modeling a dataset containing various medical information such as date of birth, weight, height, gender, allergies, chronic illnesses, and family medical history. The project demonstrates data encoding, handling missing values, normalization, and creating machine learning-ready features.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- `Cinsiyet` (Gender): Categorical 
- `Alerjilerim` (Allergies): Categorical
- `Kronik Hastaliklarim` (My Chronic Illnesses): Categorical
- `Baba Kronik Hastaliklari` (Father’s Chronic Illnesses): Categorical
- `Anne Kronik Hastaliklari` (Mother’s Chronic Illnesses): Categorical
- `Kiz Kardes Kronik Hastaliklari` (Sister’s Chronic Illnesses): Categorical
- `Erkek Kardes Kronik Hastaliklari` (Brother’s Chronic Illnesses): Categorical
- `Kan Grubu` (Blood Type): Categorical
- `Kilo` (Weight): Numerical
- `Boy` (Height): Numerical
- Date Columns ( `Ilac_Baslangic_Tarihi`, `Ilac_Bitis_Tarihi`, `Yan_Etki_Bildirim_Tarihi`, `Dogum_Tarihi`)
